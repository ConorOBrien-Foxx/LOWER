# LOWER

LOWER is written in [Attache](https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/attache), and is composed entirely of the following characters:

    ₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉ₐₑₒᵢₓₔ₊₋₌₍₎

LOWER is infix. Each of the numbers composes a numeric literal. `₊` and `₋` are addition and subtraction. `₌` performs variable assignment. `₍...₎` is a loop, which loops until the `ₐ` variable is 0.
